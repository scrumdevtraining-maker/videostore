# **Rental Movie Store**

You are asked by a Product Owner to update a very simple program. It is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer's charges at a video store. 

The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long. It then calculates the charges, which depend on how long the movie is rented, and identifies the type movie. There are three kinds of movies: regular, children's, and new releases. In addition to calculating charges, the statement also computes frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether the film is a new release.


First he wants a statement printed in HTML so that the statement can be Web enabled and fully buzzword compliant. 

Then he wants to make changes to the way movies are classified, but he has not yet decided on the change he is going to make. He has a number of changes in mind. These changes will affect both the way renters are charged for movies and the way that frequent renter points are calculated. 

Refactor this simple program to enable statement printed in html and to enable easy change of classification
